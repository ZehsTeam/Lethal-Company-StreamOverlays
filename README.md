## What does it do?
This mod hosts a local website that you can use as a browser source in OBS, Streamlabs OBS, or other streaming applications.

Currently, there's one overlay available, which displays:
* Player count
* Current moon
* Current weather
* Day count
* Quota
* Loot on the ship

> Additional overlays and customization are planned for future updates.

## How do I use it?
### 1. Installation
Install the mod with a mod manager such as:
* [Thunderstore](https://www.overwolf.com/app/thunderstore-thunderstore_mod_manager)
* [r2modman](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/ebkr/r2modman/)
* [Gale](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Kesomannen/GaleModManager/)

### 2. Launch the game
Ensure the game is running. The overlay will not work otherwise.

### 3. Add the browser source
Add the following URL as a browser source in your streaming application (e.g., OBS, Streamlabs OBS):
```
http://localhost:8080/overlay
```
* Set the **width** to **1450**
* Set the **height** to **75**

> **Streaming from another PC? Replace `localhost` in the URL with the local IP address of the computer running the game (e.g., `192.168.0.1`).**

> **Troubleshooting: If the overlay doesn't appear, refresh the browser source in your streaming application.**
